### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kristian Rumph Frederiksen and I'm currently studying my masters in finance and economics, also I work part-time at Capital Four Management, a corporate credit focused investment management firm, where I work with portfolio construction and optimization.

I use github for collaboration on projects, version control and to collect various resources from courses, MOOCs etc.
